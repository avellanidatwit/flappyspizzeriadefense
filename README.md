# Flappy's Pizzeria Defense

A playable mashup of pizza order management, lane defense, and flappy-style dodging.

## How to run

- Open `index.html` in your browser.
- Click **Start**.
- Space to flap.
- Click a topping in the shop, then click a lane to place a turret.

## Gameplay loop

- **Flappy**: dodge flying pizza boxes.
- **Defense**: turrets shoot zombies in their lane.
- **Pizzeria**: completing the top order (matching topping turret) grants a bonus.

## Notes

- Everything is plain HTML/CSS/JS. No build steps required.
- You can tweak costs, damage, or wave pacing in `game.js`.
